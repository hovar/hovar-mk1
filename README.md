# HovAR MK1
Hardware designs for first-generation HovAR image-projecting AR drone. **NOTE: This page is currently a WIP, and contains incomplete information. *Please star this repo*, and check back in a few days.**

## PARTS
Here's what you'll need to build your own HovAR MK1.
### CAD files
All of the CAD files can be found in the [/CAD](CAD) directory. Workable versions of the parts are in the [/step](CAD/step) sub-directory, and .stl files are in the [/stl](CAD/stl) sub-directory. All .stl files are in mm, and should play nice with most CAM software and slicers. *Warning: The .stp files may use different units, so be cautious if you're trying to edit a part. We'll try to fix this in an upcoming rebuild.*
### Original BOM
Here's what we used to build the MK1.
- 1 x [M3x20 Screws & Locknuts Pack](https://store.flitetest.com/m3-x-20mm-stainless-screw-pack/)
- 1 x [KK2 flight controller](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbyking-kk2-0-multi-rotor-lcd-flight-control-board.html)

### Optional Parts
Since the original build, we've made some optional adjustments to the designs to experiment and address issues we've found. The following are optional parts that should still fit well into the MK1 build. We'll list the differences between the substitute part and the original. *Note: These parts are merely recommendations, and may not have been tested on an actual build*

## BUILD
Put things together
*Some engineering and stuff*
You have cool drone!
## PROGRAMMING
Whoo! You've completed your HovAR drone! Head on over to our code repository to get the latest libraries and learn how to start working with the drone and start programming applications.
